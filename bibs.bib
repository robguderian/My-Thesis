Sensor networks must be scalable, long-lived and robust systems, overcoming energy limitations and a lack of pre-installed infrastructure. We explore three themes in the design of self-configuring sensor networks: tuning density to trade operational quality against lifetime; using multiple sensor modalities to obtain robust measurements; and exploiting fixed environmental characteristics. We illustrate these themes through the problem of localization, which is a key building block for sensor systems that itself requires coordination.},

The devices for communication on the dust motes are subject to size and power constraints, and are required to communicate over several hundred meters at a minimum data rate of 1 kbps. Optical links with active and passive transmitters and RF links are considered. A detailed analysis of the link from a passive transmitter, or corner-cube retroreflector (CCR), on the dust mote to an imaging system, either CMOS or CCD, shows the feasibility of this link. The technique used for modeling and analyzing the performance of imperfect CCRs is discussed, and some results from this analysis are presented. The design of the imaging system for high data rate reception and optimized performance is investigated. Factors governing the choice of an appropriate communication protocol are discussed.},
