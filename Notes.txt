Talk about problems with a static 'backbone'. Nodes can be out of range, backbone can break.

Talk about HCCP as middleware

Motes want to send message <---> HCCP <---> MAC Layer

given a bunch of densities... blah blah.
u(R) = (NpiR^2)/A

Find:
Best reception rate
best node life
best balance/hand-off configuration (just works pretty well)

Do an 'all clusterhead run' and compare to basic leach.

Density.
Same number of motes, more/less radio range. (Or, bigger space, but that would change the placement)
Same space, different spots.

energy dissapated rate. Like TEEN

Some with wall power... like intel's plant from Yarvis and kushalnagar
power outlet, but no extra network access

message latency
