\chapter{Experimental Setup and Results}
\label{ch:expresults}


Simulations and a testbed deployment were created to show the benefits of using HCCP over LEACH
and were used to compare the two protocols. 
To compare the performance of HCCP and LEACH, simulations were created for both of them using custom
simulation software. The simulation software is freely available on Github at (\url{http://github.com/robguderian/hccp}).
The simulation provides a high-level view of a WSN, focusing on  
how the network can function together and give insight into the network, allowing 
many different factors to be logged that would otherwise be impossible to track.

For the testbed deployment, both HCCP and LEACH code were created for four 
different types of WSN motes that have the ability to communicate with 
each other. A small deployment was then run to help show that 
the simulations are accurate and that HCCP can work
in a real-world environment.
