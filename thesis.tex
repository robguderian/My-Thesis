%hyperref is nice, I find - it turns all your references (to citations, figures, etc) into hyperlinks,
% so someone reading electronically can jump around your document.  It makes no visible marks on a
%printed copy.
\usepackage[plainpages=false,breaklinks=true]{hyperref}

%use natbib for the bibliography
\usepackage[square,comma]{natbib}
%\bibpunct{[}{]}{;}{a}{,}{,} % this is just how natbib used to require options
%note, Natbib is not required for any thesis - avoid using it if you don't like it, but it provides many nice
%features for customizable bibliographies!

%%% Clear Header %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Clear Header Style on the Last Empty Odd pages
% this lets you jump to a new odd page (I have it set up for the end of the frontmatter)
% while ensuring the blank page that is left doesn't have a running header or anything, i.e. it's
% just completely blank. -JA (from Ki-Joo Kim, 2001)

%% choose which files to process
%this was here to let you type in on the command line what you want TeX'd, and can be uncommented if you prefer to do it that way -

% bibliography: this assumes the bibtex file containing your bibliography information is named 'bibs.bib'...


%this uses the abbreviated names style - change to plainnat if you want names as they are verbatim in your bibtex
%see the included natbib documentation (included) if you want to create your own bibliography style other than these.
