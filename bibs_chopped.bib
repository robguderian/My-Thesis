Sensor networks must be scalable, long-lived and robust systems, overcoming energy limitations and a lack of pre-installed infrastructure. We explore three themes in the design of self-configuring sensor networks: tuning density to trade operational quality against lifetime; using multiple sensor modalities to obtain robust measurements; and exploiting fixed environmental characteristics. We illustrate these themes through the problem of localization, which is a key building block for sensor systems that itself requires coordination.},

  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are composed of large
                  numbers of tiny networked devices that communicate
                  untethered. For large scale networks it is important
                  to be able to dynamically download code into the
                  network. In this paper we present Contiki, a
                  lightweight operating system with support for
                  dynamic loading and replacement of individual
                  programs and services. Contiki is built around an
                  event-driven kernel but provides optional preemptive
                  multithreading that can be applied to individual
                  processes. We show that dynamic loading and
                  unloading is feasible in a resource constrained
                  environment, while keeping the base system
                  lightweight and compact.},

The devices for communication on the dust motes are subject to size and power constraints, and are required to communicate over several hundred meters at a minimum data rate of 1 kbps. Optical links with active and passive transmitters and RF links are considered. A detailed analysis of the link from a passive transmitter, or corner-cube retroreflector (CCR), on the dust mote to an imaging system, either CMOS or CCD, shows the feasibility of this link. The technique used for modeling and analyzing the performance of imperfect CCRs is discussed, and some results from this analysis are presented. The design of the imaging system for high data rate reception and optimized performance is investigated. Factors governing the choice of an appropriate communication protocol are discussed.},
